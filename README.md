# Code-Refactor

## Project description

A marketing agency has hired me to refactor the code for their main website so that it has semantic HTML elements, whilst keeping the website format the same. The reason I had taken on this challenge is to ensure that the website is more accessible to both the users and the employers of the marketing agency in addition to improving the websites codebase so that it can be sustained for a long term. By refactoring the code so that it follows the rules of semantic HTML, it helps web developers to asign different parts of a webpage and the browser. 

## Installation

1. Download VSCode if not already (Download link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. (Optional) Install the extensions that will help you get the most of this application (Chrome DevTools, HTML CSS Support).
3. For Windows users, download Git Bash. Mac users can use the terminal on thier machine.
4. Ensure that you have a GitHub account and if not, create one to access the files (Link to GitHub website: https://github.com/).

## Usage

After opening the webpage, open up Chrome DevTools (For Mac: Command+Option+I | For Windows: Control+Shift+I) to check the website layout on both the HTML and CSS files on the console panel on either side of the browser. There, you will be able to see the style of the fonts, images and layout on the HTML and CSS files accordingly. You will aslo be able to change them to how you see fit, whilst the semantic HTML rules still apply.
